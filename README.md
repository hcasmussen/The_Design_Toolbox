# The_Design_Toolbox
The Design Toolbox is a set of design methods presented in easily understandable language. The set is aimed at a younger audience. We think that the use of and the understanding of design methods can change the world for the better.
The Design Toolbox was initiated in 2018 and tested with a diverse group of 7th and 8th graders in Denmark. Additionally the set was used for a couple of workshops at Roskilde University â€“ also in Denmark. The set comitted to GitHub is version 2.0. 

We aim to translate the Box to several languages and to develop the method set on a continual basis. 

To do this we need you. 

Please help us make the Toolbox available all over the world in local translation.
